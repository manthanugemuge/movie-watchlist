# Movie Watchlist

A solo project from Scrimba. The only resource provided was a Figma design file and a link to use the [OMBb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) and the following requirements:

-   Two pages - index.html and watchlist.html.
-   Index = search page. Calls to OMDB API with the title searched for and displays search results.
-   Button to "add to watchlist" which saves that data to local storage.
-   Watchlist.html loads and displays data from local storage.

## About the Project
